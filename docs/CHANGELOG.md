- Put the project under version control, with a dependency manifest, ruff and
  pytest configuration, and a `conftest.py` so `python -m pytest` works with no
  environment setup.
- Fixed GPU encoder detection running a synchronous, un-timed `ffmpeg` probe at
  import time, which could hang startup before any window appeared. It is now
  cached and lazy.
- Added timeouts to every FFmpeg and FFprobe call, so a wedged binary can no
  longer freeze the window indefinitely.
- Replaced 125 silent exception handlers with logged ones. Set
  `NVC_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see the tracebacks behind an otherwise silent
  failure.
- Fixed scheduled deletions, unwritable configured folders, and a failed
  pending-deletion write all failing without any message.
- Fixed asset paths that resolved only because Windows filenames are
  case-insensitive.
- Replaced the hand-written help document with generated Help and Quick Start
  manuals, in PDF and DOCX, built from a single content source with
  screenshots. The Help menu opens the newest generated manual.
- Added a theme layer (`ui/theme.py`). The app's three visual states -- idle
  (teal), active (green) and locked (grayscale) -- are now named skins with one
  definition each, instead of the same colours repeated across four separate
  if/elif chains. Appearance is unchanged.
- Removed the superseded hand-written help document; the generated manuals are
  now the only help.
- Split the sidebar video preview, the easter-egg game and the conversion-queue
  bookkeeping out of the main window into their own modules, and added tests
  for the conversion worker. No user-visible change intended.
- Fixed closing NVC hanging after a conversion with a retention period set: the
  deletion timer was blocking interpreter exit for up to 30 days.
- Fixed two files with the same name in different folders writing each other's
  conversion log.
- The interface is now translatable: 367 user-facing strings are extracted into
  Qt catalogues under `translations/`. English is unchanged. Dutch and
  Simplified Chinese exist as draft catalogues awaiting translation, hidden
  unless `NVC_I18N_PREVIEW=1`. See `translations/README.md`.
- Moved the remaining stylesheet colours onto theme tokens. Changing the brand
  accent is now a single edit in `ui/theme.py`.
- Fixed the Settings dialog not showing its green active state while a
  conversion ran with monitoring stopped.
